I believe in a collaborative approach and one that assists you in finding only the interpretations that resonate with you, and are meaningful in moving forward. My approach to therapy is Psychodynamic, Relational, Existential, Humanistic and always heart-centered. My interests lie in meaning-making and helping people reach their fullest potential.
