      Welcome! I respect the courage that it takes to enter into therapy, as well as the feelings of accomplishment and vulnerability that can arise. Our work will be non-judgmental, active and collaborative.

      In our sessions, we will work to pinpoint goals, to name, understand, accept, and weather the emotions you experience, to recognize those values that are most meaningful to you, to identify and implement adaptive ways of addressing concerns, achieving goals, and navigating life transitions, and to understand the influence of past experience on present ways of thinking and relating to others.
  bio: |
      I work with individuals experiencing depression, anxiety, OCD, career, life-role, and relationship transitions as well as those seeking emotional support in dealing with medical diagnoses, loss, and trauma. I work with patients to uncover and address their core beliefs, emotions, behaviors, and thoughts. This gives patients not only the tools to cope with difficult situations, but also agency in their lives and the opportunity to thrive.

      Additionally, I have received training in women’s mental health and maternal mental health. I provide effective therapeutic care to clients experiencing premenstrual dysphoric disorder, perinatal and postpartum depression, anxiety, and OCD, as well as those coping with infertility and loss. I collaborate with patients to address cognitions and goals around the decision to have children, and relationship transitions as they become parents.

      I have worked successfully with adults and young adults experiencing depression, anxiety, and perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. I work from an LGBTQIA+ affirming perspective to provide support for individuals of all identities and family constellations. Additionally, I have an interest in work with individuals exploring identity and individuation.

      I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Barnard College, Columbia University and my Master of Arts in Mental Health Counseling from Brooklyn College, City University of New York. I completed my clinical training at the Brooklyn College Personal Counseling Center and the Seleni Institute.

      I work utilizing an integrative approach, incorporating techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, mindfulness-based approaches, and psychodynamic psychotherapy, based your individualized needs and goals.

      I look forward to meeting you and to our work together.

      At first, we will strive to learn if we can connect. We will explore and acknowledge if this is a space you can allow yourself to be seen. We will look at your challenges and strengths to understand how you have arrived at the place you find yourself today.

      My goal is to create a safe space where exploration, questioning, discovery, and feeling are possible.  I seek to be a partner who holds a light to illuminate the unknown places.

      For you, this work may be challenging, perhaps more than you imagined. However, you will not be alone. We will work together to create a path toward your goals.
  bio: |
      Although rooted in the psychodynamic principle of exploring the unconscious, familial history, and recurring behavior patterns as a path to knowing who we are today, my approach for moving past these patterns can also be understood as eclectic. Capable of being personalized to the needs of the individual, couple, or family before me. Ours would be a collaborative effort marked by respect, genuineness, deep acceptance and where possible humor and hope.

      Those who have benefited from this work have dealt with challenges ranging from anxiety/depression, trauma, grief, relationship transitions and strife, major life change, abuse, as well as parent and child relationship issues. I welcome to my practice all those identifying as coming from marginalized groups as well as those who do not, but who nonetheless wish to be seen.

      I continue to explore the intersection between all my identities (woman, person of color, professional, daughter, etc.) so that I might be more empathetic to you. I have learned and been supervised by highly experienced therapists/mentors who stretch my thinking beyond what can be accomplished alone. You too will be my collaborator and teacher as we explore, name, and strive to reach your goals.

  blurb: |-
      I believe we long to be ourselves in a society that socializes us to feel and internalize inadequacy. We often find ourselves recreating patterns as a means to cope. Perhaps you have done some self-reflection and are seeking a deeper understanding or have not yet had the opportunity to explore and bring these patterns into awareness at all. In joining with you wherever you may be, I aim to help you strengthen your emotional awareness and develop a greater sense of introspection.
  bio: |
      Through our work together, I will support you on your journey back to your authentic self. My goal is to empower you with the self-confidence and self-compassion to live a life that serves the most innate version of you, trusting that you are already whole and complete.
 
      I work with adolescents, adults, and couples around various interrelated concerns including disordered eating, body image, depression, trauma, self-worth, anxiety, sexuality, gender identity, and relationships. 
    
      I received a dual master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling from Columbia University. Currently, I am training at the Center for the Study of Anorexia & Bulimia (CSAB), specializing in the integrated treatment of eating disorders. I take great pride in prioritizing ongoing extensive training in psychodynamic and behavioral therapies, including CBT, DBT, RO-DBT. I have completed additional training in multicultural and racial considerations in therapy, microaggressions, treatment with TGNC patients, self-regulation, and sex therapy. I predominantly utilize a psychodynamic approach to not only reduce symptoms but also manage and understand the underlying issue. With that being said, our work will be tailored to your needs and strengths.

      I am a middle eastern, queer, woman who recognizes that we do not leave our social identities at the door before we enter therapy. Utilizing an intersectional, relational, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive approach to counseling, I strive to create an empowering therapeutic environment for those who are marginalized and have been historically excluded from such spaces. Showing up can feel challenging but doing so is the first step to healing, resilience, and insight. 

      I invite you to reach out if you are interested in working together. We offer telehealth and in-person services.

  blurb: |-
      When you choose to begin therapy, a match is important to growth and change. I am direct, warm and will help you confront some of the more challenging aspects of yourself. My goal is always to facilitate living the best life you can.

      Keeping that in mind, therapy can be demanding at times, and requires a lot of patience with yourself and with the work. We will learn together how to communicate about what is happening in therapy beyond the words that are used.
  bio: |
    I believe in a collaborative approach and one that assists you in finding only the interpretations that resonate with you, and are meaningful in moving forward. My approach to therapy is Psychodynamic, Relational, Existential, Humanistic and always heart-centered. My interests lie in meaning-making and helping people reach their fullest potential.

    Some of the people I work with struggle with anxiety and depression, issues in careers, people with histories of trauma, people who identify as gender nonconforming, people with chronic illness and people who come from cults or a rigid religious upbrining. I also welcome people of color into my practice and am committed to an anti antiracist stance as a white therapist.

    I continue to address patriarchy within myself to be a more conscious therapist to you. In addition to English I conduct therapy in Hebrew. See Hebrew description attached. As such, I work with people who deal with acculturation, immgitration and multicultural identities and welcome people from around the world to be listened to with an aware ear.
