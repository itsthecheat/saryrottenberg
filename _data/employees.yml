      At first, we will strive to learn if we can connect. We will explore and acknowledge if this is a space you can allow yourself to be seen. We will look at your challenges and strengths to understand how you have arrived at the place you find yourself today.

      My goal is to create a safe space where exploration, questioning, discovery, and feeling are possible.  I seek to be a partner who holds a light to illuminate the unknown places.

      For you, this work may be challenging, perhaps more than you imagined. However, you will not be alone. We will work together to create a path toward your goals.
  bio: |
      Although rooted in the psychodynamic principle of exploring the unconscious, familial history, and recurring behavior patterns as a path to knowing who we are today, my approach for moving past these patterns can also be understood as eclectic. Capable of being personalized to the needs of the individual, couple, or family before me. Ours would be a collaborative effort marked by respect, genuineness, deep acceptance and where possible humor and hope.

      Those who have benefited from this work have dealt with challenges ranging from anxiety/depression, trauma, grief, relationship transitions and strife, major life change, abuse, as well as parent and child relationship issues. I welcome to my practice all those identifying as coming from marginalized groups as well as those who do not, but who nonetheless wish to be seen.

      I continue to explore the intersection between all my identities (woman, person of color, professional, daughter, etc.) so that I might be more empathetic to you. I have learned and been supervised by highly experienced therapists/mentors who stretch my thinking beyond what can be accomplished alone. You too will be my collaborator and teacher as we explore, name, and strive to reach your goals.

  blurb: |-
      I believe we long to be ourselves in a society that socializes us to feel and internalize inadequacy. We often find ourselves recreating patterns as a means to cope. Perhaps you have done some self-reflection and are seeking a deeper understanding or have not yet had the opportunity to explore and bring these patterns into awareness at all. In joining with you wherever you may be, I aim to help you strengthen your emotional awareness and develop a greater sense of introspection.
  bio: |
      Through our work together, I will support you on your journey back to your authentic self. My goal is to empower you with the self-confidence and self-compassion to live a life that serves the most innate version of you, trusting that you are already whole and complete.

      I work with adolescents, adults, and couples around various interrelated concerns including anxiety, depression, trauma, self-worth, sexuality, gender identity, and monogamous/ethically non monogamous relationships.

      I received a dual master’s degree in Mental Health Counseling from Columbia University. Currently, I am pursuing post-graduate training at the Institute for Contemporary Psychotherapy (ICP), CSAB. I take great pride in prioritizing ongoing extensive training in psychodynamic and behavioral therapies, including CBT, DBT, RO-DBT. I have completed additional training in multicultural and racial considerations in therapy, microaggressions, treatment with TGNC patients, self-regulation, and sex therapy. I predominantly utilize a psychodynamic approach to not only reduce symptoms but also manage and understand the underlying issue. With that being said, our work will be tailored to your needs and strengths.

      I am a middle eastern, queer, woman who recognizes that we do not leave our social identities at the door before we enter therapy. Utilizing an intersectional, relational, anti-racist, and anti-oppressive approach to counseling, I strive to create an empowering therapeutic environment for those who are marginalized and have been historically excluded from such spaces. Showing up can feel challenging but doing so is the first step to healing, resilience, and insight.

      I invite you to reach out if you are interested in working together. We offer telehealth and in-person services.

  blurb: |-
      Deciding to seek professional help for coping with challenges in your life is a big step. I strive to create a safe, non-judgmental space where we can address anxiety and depression openly through identifying and exploring underlying disappointments, losses, and traumas. Through this process, we’ll work together to rewrite your “story of loss” into a “story of growth.” It is my goal that clients will be able to use the safety of our relationship to learn how to approach life’s difficulties with curiosity instead of fear.

      Together, we can find ways to address these challenges – such as the death of a loved one, a romantic break-up, LGBTQ identity exploration, or religious trauma – with courage and authenticity, and embark on a journey toward self-discovery, healing, and peace of mind.
  bio: |
      I work with individuals facing major losses in their lives, including the death of a loved one, the ending of platonic and romantic relationships, significant medical diagnoses such as HIV/AIDS and religious/spiritual changes (sometimes called a “crisis of faith”). Additionally, I have experience in working with LGBTQ+ individuals in identity exploration, the coming-out process, and dating/relationship challenges.

      I received my master’s degree in mental health counseling from Fordham
      University and completed a clinical internship at the Purchase College
      Counseling Center. Since graduating, I’ve pursued training in trauma treatment, grief counseling, and psychodynamic therapies. I am also trained to provide Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy.

      Central to my work with clients is a commitment to antiracist, anticapitalist practice. In our work together, we’ll examine how systemic factors influence your worldview and the challenges you face. My approach to therapy is grounded in psychodynamic, existential-humanistic, and narrative frameworks, and I employ a solution-focused strategy when appropriate. Above all, it is my priority that therapy is a refuge from day-to-day suffering where we can work together to find joy.

        Beginning your search for a therapist can be challenging- while I do not yet know you or what you need to hear to reach out, you can be certain that I wish to know and understand as facilitator of compassion and change.

        I invite you to join me in a warm, collaborative relationship in which we can examine how culture, relationships, and your previous experiences impact the connections you have with your mind, body, and the world. As members of society, we absorb and internalize painful beliefs about ourselves when we do not fit neatly into a certain box. For those who are feeling stuck, together we will uncover how previous experiences impact your current thoughts, moods and patterns in an effort to lead you towards a more fulfilling life.
  bio: |
        My style is geared towards those seeking a gentle, non-judgmental, yet direct approach to identifying their relational and behavioral patterns, and for those who are seeking to understand how the wounds of early life, events, and traumas have shaped their interactions.

        My experience has centered around intimate partner violence, child abuse, and trauma. I also work with adolescents, adults, and caregivers with concerns such as anxiety, depression, and life transitions. I take an intersectional/anti-racist stance and welcome gender nonconforming people, POC, and those from marginalized groups.

        The therapeutic process may challenge you in unexpected ways, but I aim to bear witness to your struggles and successes. Through our work together, you will not be alone as I seek to help you find meaning and self-acceptance.

  blurb: |-
      When you choose to begin therapy, a match is important to growth and change. I am direct, warm and will help you confront some of the more challenging aspects of yourself. My goal is always to facilitate living the best life you can.

      Keeping that in mind, therapy can be demanding at times, and requires a lot of patience with yourself and with the work. We will learn together how to communicate about what is happening in therapy beyond the words that are used.
  bio: |
    I believe in a collaborative approach and one that assists you in finding only the interpretations that resonate with you, and are meaningful in moving forward. My approach to therapy is Psychodynamic, Relational, Existential, Humanistic and always heart-centered. My interests lie in meaning-making and helping people reach their fullest potential.

    I work with people struggling with anxiety and depression, issues in careers, and histories of trauma, as well as people who identify as gender nonconforming, people with chronic illness and people who come from cults or a rigid religious upbringing. I also welcome people of color into my practice and am committed to an antiracist stance as a white therapist.

    I continue to address patriarchy within myself to be a more conscious therapist to you. In addition to English I conduct therapy in Hebrew. See Hebrew description attached. As such, I work with people who deal with acculturation, immigration and multicultural identities and welcome people from around the world who wish to be listened to with an aware ear.
