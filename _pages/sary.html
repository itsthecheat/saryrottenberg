      When you choose to begin therapy, a match is important to growth and change. I am direct, warm and will help you confront some of the more challenging aspects of yourself. My goal is to always to facilitate living the best life you can. Keeping that in mind, therapy can be demanding at times, and requires a lot of patience with yourself and with the work. We will learn together how to communicate about what is happening in therapy beyond the words that are used.
      </p>
      <p>
      My approach to therapy is Psychodynamic, Relational, Existential, Humanistic and always heart centered.  My interests lie in meaning making and helping people reach their fullest potential.
      </p>

      Some of the people I have worked with successfully in the past have struggled with anxiety and depression, careers and work struggles, people with histories of trauma, people who identify as gender nonconforming, and people with chronic illness.
      </p>
      <p>
      I believe in a collaborative approach and one that assists you in finding only the interpretations that resonate with you, and are meaningful in moving forward.  I work well with individuals who are dealing with anxiety or depression, people who are gender non-conforming or people who identify as LGBTQAI and people of color. In addition if you feel like you have been involved in a high demand society such as a cult or a rigid religious upbringing, you may have special personality developments that we can address and help you understand better.
