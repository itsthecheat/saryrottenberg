          Sary offers supervision to therapists who want to deepen their work with patients and with themselves. Curiosity, imagination, expansion of capacity for empathy, and honing one's natural intuition are developed to move treatments forward.

          <p class="info">
          My style is supportive, and keeps in mind the vulnerability and the personal aspects of bringing in challenges in oneâ€™s work as a therapist.
          The supervision is held by the containers of theory, dream work, experimental interpretations, and the transferential field.
